	<h1 id="affiliated-packages">Astropy Affiliated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>A major part of the Astropy Project is the concept of “Astropy
	affiliated packages”. An affiliated package is an astronomy-related Python
    package that is not part of the astropy core package, and is not managed by
    the project but is a part of the Astropy Project community. These packages
    demonstrate a commitment to Astropy’s goals of improving reuse,
    interoperability, and interface standards for Python astronomy and
    astrophysics packages.  In many (but not all) cases, affiliated packages
    also follow similar development processes and package templates as for the
    core package.</p>

	<p>If you are a developer interested in signing up as an affiliated package,
	details are in the <a href="#affiliated-instructions">Becoming an
	Affiliated Package</a> section.</p>

	<h1 id="coordinated-packages">Astropy Coordinated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#coordinated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>A related concept is that of “Astropy coordinated packages”. Coordinated
	packages are similar to affiliated packages, but the Astropy Project as a
	whole maintains them.  In practice this means the Astropy coordination
	committee has administrative control of a coordinated package repository
	(delegated to the maintainers), and that maintainers of these packages have
	<a href="../team.html"> formal roles</a> in the Astropy Project.  The most
    prominent of these coordinated packages is the Astropy core package itself.
    In some cases these are packages identified by the core team as needing
    development separate from the core (either they are experimental or problem
    space-focused), while others started as affiliated packages but have become
    so important to the ecosystem that they grew to become coordinated.</p>

	<h1 id="infrastructure-packages">Astropy Infrastructure Packages<a class="paralink" href="#infrastructure-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>One final related category are the "Astropy infrastructure packages".
	These packages are those that are necessary infrastructure for Astropy
	packages - e.g. testing and documentation machinery.  While occasionally
	these have astro-specific functionality, in general they are more generic
	packages that are useful to packages outside of astronomy, and as a result
	may have some maintainers outside the Astropy project. But some are also
	Astropy coordinated packages, with maintainers drawn from the infrastructure
	roles.

	<h1 id="installing-affiliated-packages">Installing Affiliated and Coordinated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#installing-affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p>All packages should be available on PyPI. Some are available via conda, particularly
	through the conda-forge channel. That said, affiliated packages are developed 
	independently of the Astropy core library. You should refer to the package's
	documentation first if you encounter problems.</p>

  <p>Astropy <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/partners.html">uses the pyOpenSci peer review process</a>
  to vet affiliated packages. If you are a developer of an astronomy package and would like your package to become
  affiliated with the Astropy Project, you submit your package directly to pyOpenSci.  
  Astropy will be involved in the review, which will allow your package to become an
  affiliated package through that review process. You can also opt to be fast tracked through
  <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">JOSS</a> if desired. Read the pyOpenSci author guide to learn
  <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html">
  how to get started with submitting a package to pyOpenSci through their affiliated partner program Guidebook</a>.
  </p>

	<p>In addition to pyOpenSci criteria, we also apply
	<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-project/blob/main/affiliated/affiliated_package_review_guidelines.md">
	Astropy-specific guidelines for reviewing affiliated packages</a>.
	This will give you a
	sense of whether your package is ready for review. Broadly speaking, your
	package should:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Comply with general pyOpenSci review standards. Please see <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/how-to/author-guide.html">Peer Review Guide for Python Open Source Authors</a> for more details.</li>

		<li>Be potentially useful to astronomers.  This can mean useful to a
		specific sub-domain of astronomy, or more broadly useful to a large
		fraction of astronomy (or beyond, as long as it is also useful for
		astronomy).</li>

		<li>Specifically use, interface with, or provide complementary capabilities
		to other Astropy packages.</li>

		<li>Use <a href="https://docs.astropy.org/">classes and functions from the
		astropy core package</a> wherever possible and appropriate, and (as much as
		possible) avoid duplication with other packages in the Astropy ecosystem.
		This facilitates re-use of code and sharing of resources.</li>

		<li>Be open to contributions from others. While this most straightforwardly
		means it follows a Github-based open development model (like the Astropy core
		package), alternative approaches are perfectly valid as long as they are
		consistent with basic principles of open source; e.g.,
		<a href="https://choosealicense.com/">an OSI-approved license</a>.</li>

		<li>Include instructions to users on how to cite your package. This is commonly done
	  with a CITATION file. This file could include a Zenodo record (highly recommended),
		acknowledgement text, and/or journal article(s). Where possible, full BibTeX entries of
		these citations are recommended.</li>

		<li>Include citations to other relevant papers and software following
		<a href="https://www.astrobetter.com/blog/2019/07/01/citing-astronomy-software-inline-text-examples/">leading
		practices for citing astronomy software</a>.</li>

	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>In addition, you should make an effort to connect with the Astropy
	developer community, including developers from the core astropy package or
	any related affiliated packages. If your package is determined to meet the above
	standards, it will be accepted and added to the affiliated package registry.
	Note however that if packages become unmaintained or do not meet the standards
	anymore, they may be removed from the list of affiliated packages, <a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/software-peer-review/our-process/policies.html#after-acceptance-package-ownership-and-maintenance">as per pyOpenSci policy.</a></p>

	<h2 id="package-template">Package Template<a class="paralink" href="#package-template" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
	<p>If you are considering creating a new astronomy package and would like it
	to be an Astropy affiliated package, you can use <a href="https://github.com/OpenAstronomy/packaging-guide">the OpenAstronomy packaging guide</a> to
	make it much easier to meet these standards. It reflects up-to-date Python packaging techniques
	to generate documentation like that used in the astropy package, a
	ready-to-use testing framework, and a variety of tools that streamline tasks
	like user configuration, caching downloaded files, or linking C-compiled
	extensions. More details on this template are available in the <a
	href="https://packaging-guide.openastronomy.org/en/latest/#using-the-template">usage
	instructions for the template</a>.
	</p>

<p>Additionally, it is also acceptable to use
<a href="https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/index.html">pyOpenSci Python Package Guide</a>
if you think that better suits your package needs.</p>

<p>We recommend that you join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astropy-affiliated-maintainers">astropy-affiliated-maintainers</a> mailing list to be kept informed of any dicussions related to affiliated packages.</p>
