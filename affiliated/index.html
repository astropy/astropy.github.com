	<h1>Affiliated Packages</h1>

	<p>A major part of the Astropy project is the concept of “Affiliated Packages”. An affiliated package is an astronomy-related Python package that is not part of the astropy core package, but has requested to be included as part of the Astropy project’s community. These packages are expressing an interest in Astropy’s goals of improving reuse, interoperability, and interface standards for python astronomy and astrophysics packages.</p>

	<p>If you are developer interested in signing up as an affiliated package, details are at the end of this page.</p>

			<h3>Montage-wrapper</h3>

			<img src="../images/montage.png" alt="Montage-wrapper" />
			
			<p><strong>About:</strong> Montage-wrapper is a pure Python module that provides a Python API to the Montage Astronomical Image Mosaic Engine, including both functions to access individual Montage commands, and high-level functions to facilitate mosaicking and re-projecting. Python-montage uses the Astropy core package for reading and writing FITS files.</p>

			<p><strong>Developer:</strong> Thomas Robitaille</p>

			<h3>Ginga</h3>

			<img src="../images/ginga.png" alt="Ginga" />

			<p><strong>About:</strong> Ginga is a viewer for astronomical data FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files. The Ginga viewer centers around a new FITS display widget which supports zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of several automatic cut levels algorithms and canvases for plotting scalable geometric forms.</p>

		<h3>APLpy</h3>

			<img src="../images/aplpy.png" alt="Montage-wrapper" />
				
			<p><strong>About:</strong> APLpy (the Astronomical Plotting Library in Python) is a Python module aimed at producing publication-quality plots of astronomical imaging data in FITS format. The module uses Matplotlib, a powerful and interactive plotting package. It is capable of creating output files in several graphical formats, including EPS, PDF, PS, PNG, and SVG.</p>

	<h2>Affiliated Packages Registry</h2>

	<p>The following table lists all currently registered affiliated packages. This table is determined from the <a href="http://affiliated.astropy.org/registry.json">json file</a>, which is the actual authoritative registry.</p>

	<table border="1" class="docutils">
	<colgroup>
	<col width="17%" />
	<col width="10%" />
	<col width="10%" />
	<col width="14%" />
	<col width="13%" />
	<col width="21%" />
	<col width="14%" />
	</colgroup>
	<thead valign="bottom">
	<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Package Name</th>
	<th class="head">Stable</th>
	<th class="head">Provisional</th>
	<th class="head">PyPI Name</th>

	<p>The Stable column indicates whether the package maintainer consider the package to be ready for use. Packages that are under heavy development and for which the user interface is likely to change significantly in the near future are marked as No.</p>

	<h2>Becoming an Affiliated Package</h2>

	<p>If you are a developer of an astronomy package and would like your package to become affiliated with the Astropy project, contact the Astropy coordination commitee by leaving a message on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev">astropy-dev</a> group requesting affiliated package status. The committee and community will consider the package based on the standards below.  If your package is judged by the committe to meet these standards, it will be added to the affiliated package registry.  If the package is not quite at these standards, but working towards them, the package will be given "provisional" status.  Provisional packages will be re-evaluated yearly by the coordinating committee.  In this re-evaluation, the package will either be judged to meet the standards and no longer be provisional, or if little or no progress is being made, it may be removed from the registry. </p>

	<p>A candidate affilated package will be judged by the coordination committee on the following standards:
	<ul>
		<li>It should use <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/">classes and functions from the astropy package</a> wherever possible and appropriate. This facilitates re-use of code and sharing of resources.  </li>

		<li>The package should have documentation that adequately explains the use of the package, at standards comparable to astropy. Additionally, user-facing classes and functions should all have docstrings. We suggest using sphinx, with the numpydoc-like <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/docguide.html">docstring standards used by astropy</a>, but this is not a strict requirement as long as the documentation is of comparable quality.</li>

		<li>The package should make a best-effort to include an easy-to-run test suite that covers its intended functionality. We realize this is not always possible, but when it is, a test suite is a crucial element of stable software and reproducible science.</li>

		<li>The package developer(s) should make an effort to connect with the Astropy developer community, including developers from  the core astropy package or any related affiliated packages.</li>

		<li>While not a strict requirement, we also provide <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/codeguide.html">coding guidelines</a> that will make your code easier to read by members of the community.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Affiliated Package Template</h2>
	<p>If you are considering creating a new astronomy package and would like it to be an Astropy affiliated package, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/astropy/package-template">package template</a> to make it much easier to meet these standards. It provides the necessary structure to generate documentation like that used in the astropy package, a ready-to-use testing framework, and a variety of tools that streamline tasks like user configuration, caching downloaded files, or linking C-compiled extensions. More details on this template are available in the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/package-template/blob/master/README.rst">usage instructions for the template</a>.
