There are many different ways you can contribute to the Astropy project!

Report issues
-------------

Even if you don't have time to contribute code or documentation, please make
sure you report any issues with the package, the documentation, or this
website, to the Astropy `issue tracker`_!

Contribute code
---------------

If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to Astropy
(whether the core package or affiliated packages), you can join the
`astropy-dev`_ mailing list, and head over to the documentation pages on
`contributing`_ to Astropy. You can either send us a patch, or (preferably)
work on a fork of Astropy and submit the changes via a pull request.

Develop an affiliated package
-----------------------------

Whether you have an idea for a new Astronomy package, or already have a
package that you want to integrate with the Astropy project, you can develop
an affiliated package! After joining the `astropy-dev`_ list and notifying
other developers of your intent to develop an affiliated package, you can head
over `here <https://github.com/astropy/package-template>`_ for instructions on
getting started! We can even create a repository for your affiliated package
in the `astropy` organization on GitHub!
