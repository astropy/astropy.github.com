    <h1 id="astropy-credits">Astropy Credits<a class="paralink"
    href="#astropy-credits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>The Astropy Project is made possible through the hard work of hundreds of
    people in the community. Contributions take many forms, from participating
    in online forums, being an Astropy sub-committee member, giving talks,
    writing tutorials and documentation, writing code, making releases,
    organizing conferences, and much much more.</p>

    <p>In this page we specially recognize the people and organizations that
    have made significant contributions to the Astropy project. This comes in
    the form of <a href="#lifetime-credits">lifetime contributors</a> and <a
    href="#institutional-support">institutional support</a> that provides both
    direct and indirect funding for Astropy.

    </p>

<section>
<h1 id="lifetime-credits">Lifetime Contributors<a class="paralink"
href="#lifetime-credits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>Here we list individuals who estimate they have spent 2000 hours or more,
    equivalent to full time for a year, working on and contributing to the
    Astropy Project. These individuals have demonstrated a long-term commitment
    to the project in many areas and exemplify the high standards we seek to
    achieve.
    </p>

    <h3>Adrian Price-Whelan</h3>
    Adrian is the lead coordinator and developer behind the Learn Astropy and
    Astropy tutorials initiatives. He was an initial contributor of the concept
    and code for the Quantity class in astropy.units and serves as lead
    developer of astropy.coordinates. In the latter role he was a key player in
    adding support for velocity data such as proper motions in
    astropy.coordinates.

    <h3>Brigitta Sipőcz</h3>
    Since coming to the project in
    2014, Brigitta has been an active and valued member of the Astropy community
    in many key roles. Most notably, she has developed and maintains
    responsibility for critical parts of the Astropy infrastructure which keep
    the core package and affiliated packages running smoothly for both testing
    and release distribution. She is an astropy core release manager and
    the GSoC coordinator for Astropy.

    <h3>Erik Tollerud</h3>
    Erik has played a key leadership and technical role in the Astropy project
    since it began in 2011. His individual contributions are too numerous to
    name, but they include contributing large parts of the core coordinates and
    uncertainties packages, serving in the Coordination Committee since 2011,
    serving as a release manager and a number of infrastructure roles, providing
    leadership on writing the Astropy papers and proposals, and Finance
    committee work.

    <h3>Kelle Cruz</h3>
    Kelle has been on the Coordination Committee since 2016 with a focus on
    community management, user discussion forums, workshops, and expanding
    educational materials. Her role as the Learn Coordinator has been especially
    impacting. She has played a crucial lead role in the areas of governance,
    fundraising, and grant writing as Astropy has grown into a large and widely
    recognized project.

    <h3>Larry Bradley</h3>
    Larry has served as the lead developer and maintainer of the Photutils
    package (an Astropy coordinated package for source detection and photometry)
    since 2014. He also is as a maintainer of the astropy regions package
    and the astropy visualization, stats, and convolution subpackages.

    <h3>Madison Bray</h3>
    Madison was a founding member of the Astropy project and was the main
    developer of the io.fits core subpackage which forms the basis of much of
    the I/O for astropy. After taking a hiatus from Astropy in 2016 for another
    opportunity, Madison rejoined in the role of DevOps and Operations Support
    in 2020.

    <h3>Marten van Kerkwijk</h3>
    Marten has been actively involved in astropy core development since 2013. He
    has made many key contributions, most notably leading the effort to make
    Quantities truly useful throughout astropy by working with and contributing to numpy to ensure interaction 
    with numpy functions became seemless, and optimizing their use inside coordinates. He led
    the development of algorithm improvements in the Time class to ensure
    accuracy at the level needed for pulsar timing, and he played an important
    role in making the Table class versatile.

    <h3>Michael Droettboom</h3>
    Michael was a prolific contributor to Astropy from 2011 through 2015,
    contributing over 400 pull requests in many areas of the core, with a focus
    on the wcs, votable, and table subpackages. His deep understanding of best
    coding practices provided important inspiration for other members of the
    initial core development team.

    <h3>Moritz Günther</h3>
    Moritz has been involved in the Project since 2011, with contributions to
    the io.ascii package and a continuing role as a package maintainer. He has
    also contributed to the stats core subpackage and the photutils and saba
    packages. Since 2020, Moritz has been serving as an Affiliated Package
    review editor and has been an active member of the interim Finance Committee

    <h3>Nadia Dencheva</h3>
    Nadia has been an active member of the project since it started, where she
    has been the lead developer and maintainer for the modeling and wcs
    packages. She has also been involved with the serialization of astropy
    objects to the ASDF format.

    <h3>Perry Greenfield</h3>
    More than any other single person, Perry has been responsible for the
    adoption of Python in astronomy. He recognized the promise of Python as a
    language for astronomical data analysis and processing far before the rest
    of the community and was responsible for an institutional commitment of
    substantial resources in this direction. Perry was a key player in the
    initial formation of the Astropy project and served as a Coordination
    Committee member from 2011 to 2016. In 2020, Perry took on the role of
    Ombudsperson.

    <h3>Pey Lian Lim</h3>
    Pey Lian has been an important team member since 2012, providing key
    infrastructure and operational support focused on the core package. In her
    maintainer roles for testing and documentation infrastructure and DevOps and
    Operations Support, she keeps Astropy running. Special commendation is due
    for leading the extremely rapid and unexpected migration from Travis CI to
    GitHub Actions in 2020. Pey Lian's tireless attention in triaging core
    issues is well-recognized.

    <h3>Simon Conseil</h3>
    After a first pull request in 2012, Simon became a regular contributor to
    Astropy around 2015. Since 2017 he has been the main maintainer of io.fits,
    taking on the daunting role of managing this complex and critical
    subpackage. He also contributes other parts of Astropy including
    infrastructure, modeling, io.ascii, stats, table, and visualization.

    <h3>Tom Aldcroft</h3>
    In 2011, Tom was part of an initial core group that recognized the need for
    a common Astropy package for the community, and he helped organize the first
    official Astropy coordination meeting. Since that time he has been an active
    contributor to the project, taking a lead role in the development and
    maintenance of three core subpackages: table, time, and io.ascii. In 2016 he
    was appointed as one of the Astropy Project Coordination Committee members.

    <h3>Tom Robitaille</h3>
    Tom has been a recognized leader in the Astropy project since it began,
    being part of the core group that started the project and organized the
    first Astropy coordination meeting. His individual contributions are too
    numerous to name, but they include contributing large parts of the core
    package covering many areas, developing the astropy-healpix and regions
    coordinated packages, serving as a release manager, GSoC coordinator, and
    member of the Coordination Committee.

<h1 id="institutional-support">Institutional Support<a class="paralink"
href="#institutional-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

Here we recognize the institutions who have made major contributions to the
Astropy project by either direct funding to the project or by indirect funding
of employees who have contributed.

<h3>Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)</h3>
STScI has played a foundational role in the development and advancement of the
Astropy Project since its inception. STScI has provided continued and
substantial support to the project via staff contributions since 2011, including
six lifetime contributors to astropy.  Additionally, STScI has provided on-going
support and leadership to both Astropy and the  broader scientific Python
computing ecosystem.

<h3>Moore Foundation</h3>
In late 2019 the Astropy project was awarded a major grant from the Gordon and
Betty Moore Foundation. This grant was targeted at supporting Astropy’s
transition to a fully sustainable project, where success no longer hinges on a
limited set of contributors. This grant was transformative for the Project.

<h3>Chandra X-ray Center (CXC)</h3>
The CXC has supported multiple staff members to work on the Astropy project,
equivalent to   more than 5 person-years since the start of the project.

<h3>NumFocus</h3>
We wish to express gratitude to the NumFocus Organization for providing the
organizational support to grow Astropy into the role of a community-leading
project with a substantial budget.

<h3>Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA), Flatiron Institute, Simons
Foundation</h3>
The CCA has provided logistical and travel support for the Python in Astronomy
conference, the coordination meeting, and the spectroscopy working
group.
