    <h1 id="astropy-credits">Astropy Credits<a class="paralink" href="#astropy-credits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>The Astropy Project is made possible through the hard work of hundreds of
    people in the community. Contributions take many forms, from participating
    in online forums, being an Astropy sub-committee member, giving talks,
    writing tutorials and documentation, writing code, making releases,
    organizing conferences, and much much more.</p>

    <p>In this page we specially recognize the people and organizations that
    have made significant contributions to the Astropy project. This comes in
    the form of <a href="#lifetime-credits">lifetime contributors</a> and <a
    href="#institutional-support">institutional support</a> that provides both
    direct and indirect funding for Astropy.

    </p>

<h1 id="lifetime-credits">Lifetime Contributors<a class="paralink" href="#lifetime-credits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>Here we list individuals who estimate they have spent 2000 hours or more,
    equivalent to full time for a year, working on and contributing to the
    Astropy Project. These individuals have demonstrated a long-term commitment
    to the project in many areas and exemplify the high standards we seek to
    achieve.
    </p>

    <h3 id="adam-ginsburg">Adam Ginsburg</h3>
    Together with others, Adam initiated development of the astroquery and
    regions packages, and continued maintaining or contributing to both since.
    He developed the fft part of the convolution package and maintained it
    since.  Adam played small roles in a number of other areas, but particularly
    recently in outreach to the radio community by creating tools
    (spectral-cube, etc.) that link radio data to astropy.

    <h3 id="adrian-price-whelan">Adrian Price-Whelan</h3>
    Adrian is the lead coordinator and developer behind the Learn Astropy and
    Astropy tutorials initiatives. He was an initial contributor of the concept
    and code for the Quantity class in astropy.units and serves as lead
    developer of astropy.coordinates. In the latter role he was a key player in
    adding support for velocity data such as proper motions in
    astropy.coordinates.

    opportunity, Madison rejoined in the role of DevOps and Operations Support
    in 2020.

    <h3 id="marten-van-kerkwijk">Marten van Kerkwijk</h3>
    Marten has been actively involved in astropy core development since 2013. He
    has made many key contributions, most notably leading the effort to make
    Quantities truly useful throughout astropy by working with and contributing to numpy to ensure interaction 
    with numpy functions became seemless, and optimizing their use inside coordinates. He led
    the development of algorithm improvements in the Time class to ensure
    accuracy at the level needed for pulsar timing, and he played an important
    role in making the Table class versatile.

    <h3 id="matt-craig">Matt Craig</h3>
    Since becoming involved in the project in fall 2013, Matt co-led the
    development of ccdproc, the coordinated package for optical/IR image data
    reduction and served as lead for the NDData subpackage. He also served
    on multiple Python in Astronomy organizing committees, helped with a couple
    of coordination meetings, and worked hard to make sure the astropy ecosystem
    of packages is available on major platforms to improve accessibility.

    <h3 id="michael-droettboom">Michael Droettboom</h3>
    Michael was a prolific contributor to Astropy from 2011 through 2015,
    contributing over 400 pull requests in many areas of the core, with a focus
    on the wcs, votable, and table subpackages. His deep understanding of best

    packages. She has also been involved with the serialization of astropy
    objects to the ASDF format.

    <h3 id="perry-greenfield">Perry Greenfield</h3>
    More than any other single person, Perry has been responsible for the
    adoption of Python in astronomy. He recognized the promise of Python as a
    language for astronomical data analysis and processing far before the rest
    of the community and was responsible for an institutional commitment of
    substantial resources in this direction. Perry was a key player in the
    initial formation of the Astropy project and served as a Coordination
