		<h1>Contribute to Astropy</h1>

		<p>The Astropy project is made both by and for its users, so we accept contributions of many kinds. We always welcome contributors who will abide by the <a href="about.html#codeofconduct">Astropy Community Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

	</section>

	<section id="feedback">
		<h2>Contribute feedback</h2>

	<p>There are several ways in which you can give us feedback. </p>

	<ul>
	<li>If you would like to give us feedback and participate in discussions, we encourage you to join the <a href="http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/astropy"> astropy mailing list </a> and post there. This is the easiest way to have a discussion with both developers and other users.  </li>
	<li>If you have feedback you would prefer to keep private, you can e-mail <a href="mailto:feedback@astropy.org">feedback@astropy.org</a>. This address points to a private mailing list that includes the astropy core developers. If you would like a reply (e.g., an acknowledgement of your comment), please request it.</li>
	<li>For the extremely impatient, astropy developers often can be found in <a href="https://gitter.im/astropy/astropy">Astropy's gitter channel</a>. Gitter is basically a live web chat, but with features that make it better for discussing code. If you prefer using IRC clients for chat, there is <a href="https://irc.gitter.im/">a gitter to IRC bridge</a>.</li>
	</ul>

		<h2>Contribute code or documentation</h2>

		<p>If you are interested in contributing fixes, code or documentation to Astropy (whether the core package or affiliated packages), you should join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev">astropy-dev</a> mailing list/forum, and start looking at any related <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues">issues</a>. In particular, we have introduced a labeling system used across most Astropy-related packages which will allow you to find good starting issues.  A good label to start with is <a href="https://github.com/search?p=2&q=label%3Apackage-novice+user%3Aastropy&ref=searchresults&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93" class="github-label-package">Package-novice</a> which means you don't need much prior experience of the package. You can use the following links to find all the issues labelled this way and also labeled by how much work they involve:</p>
    <ul>
    	
      <li><a href="https://github.com/search?p=2&q=label%3Apackage-novice+user%3Aastropy+label%3Aeffort-low&ref=searchresults&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93" class="github-label-effort">Effort-low</a>: issues that should take a few hours at most
      <li><a href="https://github.com/search?p=2&q=label%3Apackage-novice+user%3Aastropy+label%3Aeffort-medium&ref=searchresults&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93" class="github-label-effort">Effort-medium</a>: issues that should take a few days at most
      <li><a href="https://github.com/search?p=2&q=label%3Apackage-novice+user%3Aastropy+label%3Aeffort-high&ref=searchresults&state=open&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93" class="github-label-effort">Effort-high</a>: longer term issues
      </ul>
      <p>You may also want to familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/#developer-documentation" target="_blank">developer documentation</a>, particularly the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/codeguide.html">coding</a> and <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/development/docguide.html">documentation</a> guidelines.</p>

		<p> Once you have a change to propose, if it's a simple fix to just a single file, you can even just browse to the appropriate file and use the "edit" button on github.  If it's a more complex change, we suggest you follow the <a target="_blank" href="index.html#dev">developer install instructions</a>, and use that with <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy">Astropy's github page</a> to issue a pull request with your changes.  If you aren't familiar with github, we suggest you looking over our <a href="http://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/workflow/development_workflow.html">workflow documentation</a>. Once your code is accepted, you are officially an Astropy contributor and eligible to be included on the author list of future publications.  </p>

		<p> If you want to propose a larger change to Astropy, there's a procedure for that:  <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs">Astropy Proposals for Enhancement (APEs)</a> (modeled after Python's <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/">PEPs</a>).  The sort of changes that APEs are intended for include plans for new sub-packages, wide-ranging code re-organizations, a new procedure needing review by a lot of the Astropy community, or an informational document on some decision for Astropy that you want remembered.  For more background on APEs, check out <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE1.rst">APE #1</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/README.rst">APE repository's README</a>.  There is also a <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/APE-Overview">wiki page on Astropy's github repository</a> that has an overview of the existing APEs.</p>

		<h2>Develop an affiliated package</h2>

		<p>Whether you have an idea for a new Astronomy package, or already have a package that you want to integrate with the Astropy project, you can develop an affiliated package! You'll want to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev">astropy-dev</a> list so you can notifying other developers of your intent to develop an affiliated package, and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astropy-affiliated-maintainers">astropy-affiliated-maintainers</a> mailing list to be kept informed of updates to the package template, as well as to have any dicussions related to setting up affiliated packages.  Then you can check out the <a href="affiliated/index.html#affiliated-instructions">affiliated package guidelines</a> and the <a href="http://github.com/astropy/package-template">template for new affiliated packages</a> to get started. We can even create a repository for your affiliated package in the astropy organization on GitHub, if you ask on the mailing list!</p>
