	<h1 id="about-the-astropy-project">About The Astropy Project<a class="paralink" href="#about-the-astropy-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

	<p> The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a core package
	for astronomy using the
	<a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming language</a>
	and improve usability, interoperability, and collaboration between astronomy
	Python packages.  The core <i>astropy</i> package contains functionality aimed
	at professional astronomers and astrophysicists, but may be useful to anyone
	developing astronomy software.  The Astropy Project also includes
	"affiliated packages," Python packages that are not necessarily developed by
	the core development team, but share the goals of Astropy, and often build
	from the core package's code and infrastructure. </p>

    <p>Aside from the actual code, Astropy is also a community of astronomy-
    associated users and developers that agree that sharing utilities is
    healthy for the community and the science it produces. This community is
    of course central to accomplishing anything with the code itself.
    We welcome anyone who
    wishes to contribute to the project and expect everyone in our community
    to follow the <a href="code_of_conduct.html">code of conduct</a> when interacting with others.</p>

    <p>For more details on the plan for the project, you can read the
	<a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/overview.html">documentation overview</a>,
	or the
	<a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/vision.html">original vision</a>
	from when the project was founded. </p>

    <section>
    <h1 id="astropy-core-package"><i>astropy</i> Core Package<a class="paralink" href="#astropy-core-package" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>The <i>astropy</i> package (alternatively known as the "core" package)
    contains various classes, utilities, and a packaging framework intended
    to provide commonly-used astronomy tools. It is divided into a variety
    of sub-packages, which are described in detail in the
    <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/">documentation</a>.</p>

    <p>The core also provides this documentation, and a variety of utilities
    that simplify starting other python astronomy/astrophysics packages. As
    described in the following section, these simplify the process of
    creating affiliated packages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h1 id="affiliated-packages">Affiliated Packages<a class="paralink" href="#affiliated-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

    <p>The Astropy project includes the concept of "affiliated packages." An
    affiliated package is an astronomy-related python package that is not
    part of the <i>astropy</i> core source code, but has requested to be included
    in the general community effort of the Astropy project. Such a package
    may be a candidate for eventual inclusion in the main <i>astropy</i> package
    (although this is not required). Until then, however, it is a separate
    package, and may not be in the <i>astropy</i> namespace.</p>

    <p>The authoritative list of current affiliated packages is available at
    <a href="http://affiliated.astropy.org">http://affiliated.astropy.org</a>,
    including a machine-readable
    <a href="http://affiliated.astropy.org/registry.json">JSON file</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in starting an affiliated package, or have a
    package you are interested in making more compatible with astropy, the
    <i>astropy</i> core package includes features that simplify and homogenize
    package management. Astropy provides a
    <a href="http://github.com/astropy/package-template">package template</a>
    that provides a common
    way to organize a package, to make your life simpler. You can use this
    template either with a new package you are starting or an existing
    package to give it most of the organizational tools Astropy provides,
    including the documentation, testing, and Cython-building tools.  See
    the <a href="https://github.com/astropy/package-template/blob/master/README.rst">
    usage instructions</a> in the template
    for further details.</p>

    <p>To then get your package listed on the registry, take a look at the
    <a href="http://affiliated.astropy.org#affiliated-instructions">
    guidelines for becoming an affiliated package </a>, and then post
    your intent on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/astropy-dev">
    astropy-dev mailing list</a>.  The Astropy
    coordination committee, in consultation with the community, will provide
    you feedback on the package, and will add it to the registry when it is
    approved. </p>
