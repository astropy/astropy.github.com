<p>
<b>Q: What is tested on GitHub Actions and why?</b><br/>
A: Test matrix involving different architecture, OSes, dependency combos, and
dependency versions. The goal is to catch most of the incompatibilities or bugs
before a pull request is merged or a release.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: What is tested on Circle CI and why (as opposed to Travis)?</b><br/>
A: CircleCI complements GitHub Actions by running jobs that the latter cannot
easily support, such as jobs that require access to artifacts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: What tests are matrixed via tox as opposed to being build jobs in a CI service and why?</b><br/>
A: Usage of tox was implemented as per
<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE17.rst">APE 17</a>.
It is used to handle most of the test matrix, except for some of the
visualization jobs in Circle CI because (Tom R and Stuart M should fill in here).
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: Why did we stop using conda in CI?</b><br/>
A: With the switch to tox (see above), which provides isolated builds, we
no longer need conda to do so. Over the years, conda resolver takes longer to
run. In addition, the overhead in fixing conda issues unrelated to the package
itself has also increased.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: What does ci-helpers actually do and why does it exist?</b><br/>
A: Please see
<a href="https://github.com/astropy/ci-helpers/blob/master/README.md">ci-helpers README</a>.
It was created to decrease code duplication and to ease setting up Travis CI
and Appveyor CI for packages within the Astropy project. However, now that Astropy
has moved away from both of those services, ci-helpers is no longer actively
developed nor maintained.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: What happened to astropy-helpers?</b><br/>
A: Astropy has dropped usage and support for astropy-helpers as per
<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE17.rst">APE 17</a>.
If you still have a package that uses it and it works for you, then great.
However, if it stops working, we recommend you migrate away using the
<a href="https://docs.astropy.org/projects/package-template/en/latest/ape17.html">APE 17 migration guide</a>.
