        <h1>A brief history of the Astropy Project</h1>

        <p>Some of the earliest use of Python in astronomy was at the Space Telescope
        Science Institute (STScI) with their release of PyRAF around 2000. That
        release helped raise awareness of Python as a scripting language, leading to
        its use at more institutions. STScI was also active in the development of
        Python tools for science, including a pre-cursor to numpy and early versions
        of matplotlib. By the early 2010s there were multiple independent efforts
        by institutions and individuals to use Python for data analysis.</p>

        <p>The initial trigger for Astropy was a <a
        href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/astropy/2011-June/001075.html">conversation
        in 2011 on the astropy mailing list (which pre-dated The Astropy Project by
        over a decade)</a> on the topic of how many “general astronomy” packages were
        being written in Python. This discussion thread led to the creation of a <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140811231510/http://astropy.wikispaces.com/%20“Original%20astropy%20wiki”">short-lived
        wiki</a> where over 100 participants voted in favor of a shared package to
        combine the efforts of these different developers into a single space. This
        demonstrated broad interest in such an effort. With that motivation and
        charge in place, this same wiki was used to organize a planning meeting for
        this effort.</p>

        <p>That planning meeting, in Fall 2011, was the formal beginning of the
        Astropy Project and was held at the <a
        href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/CfAMeeting2011%20“CfA%20Astropy%20meeting”">Harvard
        Center for Astrophysics</a>. The <a
        href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki/CfAMeeting2011#participants%20“CfA%20meeting%20participants”">list
        of attendees</a> at that meeting underscores what has been essential to the
        launch, growth, and continued development of Astropy: it was a mix of
        graduate students, postdocs, scientists, and professional software developers.
        The attendees with permanent positions were willing to contribute both code
        and their time to the project; Space Telescope Science Institute
        (STScI) additionally contributed substantial staff time to the project. The
        early-career attendees had either already devoted substantial time to code
        development, would do so over the ensuing years, or both.</p>

        <p>The foundation of Astropy’s subsequent success was the combination of
        institutional resources, a deliberate effort to include and foster the growth
        of a broad community of contributors, the rapid growth of GitHub and the
        surrounding ecosystem of open source development tools, and a willingness of
        early-career professionals to contribute code to an open community project.
        The initial release for users of the core astropy package, version 0.2 on
        February 19, 2013, was less than 18 months after the CfA meeting and already
        contained many of the core subpackages that are part of the package today.
        That was possible only because some of the code already existed in a form
        that could be adapted to Astropy. Major pieces had been written by staff at
        STScI that were contributed by the Institute to the project. There were also
        large contributions from early participants who were graduate students and
        postdocs.</p>

        <p>By the time of the first stable release in 2013, the number of contributors
        to the code base was over 20, including several people who were not involved
        in the initial meeting. Though most of the lines of code at that point had
        been written by a handful of people, the effort they put into welcoming and
        supporting new contributors was just as important and is not easily captured
        in a single number. The project made an effort early on to provide prompt,
        constructive, and welcoming feedback to new contributors. The promptness was
        a key factor in encouraging early contributors and was possible in part
        because STScI devoted substantial staff time to the project with the explicit
        intent of growing the community of contributors.</p>

        <p>One of the Project’s first efforts to formally recruit early career
        scientists was participation in
        <a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy/wiki#google-summer-of-code">Google’s Summer of Code (GSoC) program</a>.
        That program provides participants with a stipend in exchange for doing
        extensive work on open source projects during the northern hemisphere summer.
        It was the first of several efforts to grow the community of contributors.
        These efforts yielded a handful of very active long-term contributors to the
        project whose cumulative work goes well beyond the initial code contributions
        made by participants.</p>

        <p>Another critical element in the growth of the Astropy Project was the
        Python in Astronomy conference series. The first Python in Astronomy
        conference was held in 2015. The hope was that the conference would encourage
        the development of Python packages in astronomy outside of the astropy core,
        foster the adoption of Astropy in the broader community, and serve as an
        introduction to contributing to open source software. Though it was not an
        Astropy conference, many of the astropy core developers were attending. For
        example, the initial Code of Conduct for the Astropy Project was written at
        the conference and the “Python in Astronomy” Facebook group was started,
        among <a href="http://openastronomy.org/pyastro/2015/">other
        activities</a>.</p>

        <p>The intent from the first coordination meeting in 2011 was to put some
        functionality into more specialized packages, called affiliated packages,
        that were developed independent of the core project but followed the same
        coding, testing and documentation conventions and often used the same
        continuous integration (CI) infrastructure. The first affiliated packages
        were created in 2011. That model has been quite successful: as of early 2022
        there are almost 50 affiliated packages (pre-APE 22). The use of common conventions across
        the packages has eased the burden of maintaining those packages as the
        project ecosystem grows.</p>

        <p>Deliberate community development has been essential to the success of the
        Project and has included several aspects. Astropy was an early and
        enthusiastic adopter of an explicit Code of Conduct. This served to formalize
        the welcoming atmosphere established early in the project. Community presence
        has included setting up social media spaces for Python in Astronomy,
        workshops at AAS meetings, work on learning materials for Astropy and
        development of the project’s web presence. The Facebook group “Python in
        Astronomy’’ has been wildly successful with over 6400 members and nearly
        daily postings. This success is in part because of careful moderation by
        members of the project early in the list's history to keep conversations on topic, though community moderators have taken on more of those responsibilities as time has gone on. Workshops at AAS
        meetings have helped several hundred astronomers adopt Python and astropy as
        part of their workflow.</p>

        <p>The day-to-day effort of managing the Astropy codebase is unglamorous but
        critical. Tasks include promptly labeling and triaging new issues, responding
        to new pull requests, and watching for and fixing changes that break part of
        the infrastructure. There have been times when that infrastructure has
        shifted very rapidly, such as when <a
        href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2020-11-02-travis-ci-new-billing%20“Travis-CI%20open%20sources%20limits”">Travis-CI
        stopped hosting open source packages</a>. Transitioning the entire ecosystem
        to a new infrastructure required substantial effort by a number of people,
        though it was facilitated primarily by a single individual. Indeed, much of
        this day-to-day work has been done by a handful of people, many of whom are
        in permanent positions at STScI and a few other institutions.</p>

        <p>The patterns at the beginning of the project have persisted throughout: it
        is the combined effort of individuals and institutions that includes
        scientists and software developers. It includes early-career individuals and
        those in permanent positions.</p>

        <p>There are a few important changes to the project since its inception. One
        is external funding from the Moore Foundation in 2019 and from NASA in 2022,
        which provides monetary support for contributors at all career stages in
        addition to funding for Project needs. Another is the establishment of a
        formal governance structure
        (<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/main/APE0.rst">APE 0
        adopted in 2021</a>) that is open and responsive to community needs.</p>

        <p>Another development that was perhaps not envisioned at the start of the
        project is some contributors choosing to make Astropy an essential part of
        their career. Their involvement since the beginning of the project has
        provided continuity to the project and represents taking a risk that
        potential future employers may not scientifically value this software work,
        regardless of its impact on astronomy as a whole.</p>

        <p>As of summer 2022, the success of the Project hinged on a number of factors,
        including the willingness of institutions and individuals to contribute
        extensive prior work to a community project, a deliberate effort to foster
        new contributors, and an effort to create a welcoming community. It is
        difficult to see how the project could have come so far absent any of these
        factors or absent any one of the groups of contributors. Institutional
        support and individual contributions has been inextricably linked.</p>
