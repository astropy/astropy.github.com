		<h1 id="astropy-community-code-of-conduct">Astropy Community Code of Conduct<a class="paralink" href="#astropy-community-code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>

		<p>The community of participants in open source Astronomy projects is made
		up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
		personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
		community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in
		our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both
		inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive,
		inclusive, successful, and growing community.</p>

		<p>As members of the community,</p>

		<ul>

		<li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and
		bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or
		gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
		nationality, ethnicity, political view, and religion. In particular, sexual language and
		imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not
		appropriate.</li>

		<li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
		acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge
		to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
		acknowledged.</li>

		<li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
		realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds
		will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating
		to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are
		welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to
		ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can
		freely express their opinions.</li>

		<li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
		particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide
		respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion
		threads resulting from code contributions.</li>

		<li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community
		and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors
		that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community
		and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with
		the same respect as people within our community.</li>

		<li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and
		to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will
		take action when members of our community violate this code such as
		contacting confidential@astropy.org (all emails sent to this address will be
		treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the
		person.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
		offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences,
		meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.</p>

		<p>Any related activity or project organized by members of the Astropy
		community, including affiliated packages, are welcome to have their own
		codes of conduct, but agree to also abide by the present code of
		conduct.</p>

		<p>Parts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the PSF code of
		conduct.</p>

We encourage other communities related to ours to use or adapt this code as they see fit.</p>
